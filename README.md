# AWS s3 upload script

Curious
A while ago I made a Python script to upload files to an S3 bucket. It's a simple script that uses the `boto3` library to interact with the AWS API. Check it out [here](https://github.com/PyBites-Open-Source/pybites-tools/blob/main/pybites_tools/aws.py).

In this repo I made a similar script in Rust using the rusoto crate to do the same thing.
